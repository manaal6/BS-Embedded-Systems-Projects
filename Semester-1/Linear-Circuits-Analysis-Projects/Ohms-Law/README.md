# Ohmâ€™s Law Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To verify **Ohmâ€™s Law** (V = IR) using Multisim.

## âš¡ Circuit Setup
- DC Source = 10 V
- Resistor = 1 kÎ©
- Ammeter in series
- Voltmeter across resistor

## ðŸ”Ž Results
- Voltage across R = 10 V
- Current through R = 10 mA
- Verified that V = I Ã— R
